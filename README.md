# Software Testing

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It involves executing the software under controlled conditions to identify any defects, errors, or gaps in functionality. The main goals of software testing are to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the software.

## Key Aspects of Software Testing

### Types of Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Involves human testers manually executing test cases without the use of automation tools.
- **Automated Testing**: Involves using software tools to execute pre-scripted tests on the application automatically.

### Levels of Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work correctly.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between integrated units/modules to ensure they work together as expected.
- **System Testing**: Testing the complete integrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Testing the system in a real-world environment to ensure it meets the business needs and requirements.

### Types of Tests
- **Functional Testing**: Validating the software against the functional requirements/specifications.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Testing aspects such as performance, usability, reliability, and security.
- **Regression Testing**: Re-running previously conducted tests to ensure that new changes have not adversely affected the existing functionality.
- **Smoke Testing**: Preliminary testing to check whether the basic functionalities of a software application are working.
- **Sanity Testing**: Checking specific functionalities after making minor changes to ensure that bugs are fixed and no further issues are introduced.

### Techniques and Tools
- **Black Box Testing**: Testing without knowing the internal workings of the application.
- **White Box Testing**: Testing with knowledge of the internal logic of the application's code.
- **Gray Box Testing**: A combination of black-box and white-box testing.

Common tools used in software testing include Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, QTP, and many others, depending on the type of testing and the platform being tested.

The software testing process helps identify and fix issues early, reducing the risk of defects in the final product and improving overall user satisfaction.
